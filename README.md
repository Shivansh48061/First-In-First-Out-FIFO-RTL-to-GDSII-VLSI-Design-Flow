# First-In-First-Out-FIFO-RTL-to-GDSII-VLSI-Design-Flow
This project implements a FIFO memory using Verilog and demonstrates the complete ASIC design flow from RTL to GDSII using Cadence tools. The flow includes synthesis, floorplanning, placement, CTS, routing, timing analysis, and physical verification.
